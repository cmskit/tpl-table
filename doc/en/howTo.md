# cms-kit Template Table

## Goal

This -partly[^1] generalized- Template shows your Entries as a searchable, sortable, paginated Table allowing a faster access than the List of the default Template. Connected Entries are loaded as a expandable Sub-Table (of course also Sub-Tables are also sortable).

[^1] : this Template does not show generic Fields because of their nature (every Entry can have a different Structure witch dosen't fit into a "Table").

## Activation
